# EbolaTransmissionAndSpread-DynamicSystemModeling

### Summary:
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a severe, often fatal illness with a case fatality rate of 25–90%. To manage and prevent outbreaks, a dynamic simulation model helps analyze transmission patterns, support risk management, and guide vaccine stockpiling.

EVD spreads through contact with infected animals or bodily fluids of infected individuals. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, bleeding, and organ failure. It is not contagious until symptoms appear.

Key outbreaks occurred in 1976, 2014–2016 (West Africa), and 2018–2021 (DRC). Treatments include supportive care and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Inmazeb, Ebanga). Vaccines like Ervebo and Zabdeno-Mvabea are approved for prevention.

Since Ebola persists and can cross borders, dynamic modeling is vital for early detection and outbreak control.
